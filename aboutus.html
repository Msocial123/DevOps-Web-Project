            <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
            <p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary to Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.</p>
            <h3>Use Cases:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</li>
                <li>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</li>
                <li>Monitoring and Logging</li>
                <li>Microservices</li>
